# Twitter Bot with JavaScript

## Overview

This project is a simple Twitter bot written in JavaScript that tweets automatically at predefined intervals. The bot reads tweets from a file, avoids repetition, and uses the Twitter API for communication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A Twitter Developer account and API keys (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-bot.git
   cd twitter-bot

    Install dependencies:

    bash
   ```

npm install

Create a .env file in the project root with your Twitter API keys:

env

    CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
    CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
    ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret

    Add your tweets to the tweets.txt file, one tweet per line.

Usage

Run the bot with the following command:

bash

node bot.js

The bot will start tweeting at the predefined intervals. Adjust the interval and tweet content as needed.
Customization

    Tweet Content: Add or modify tweets in the tweets.txt file.
    Interval: Adjust the tweet interval in the tweetWithInterval function in bot.js.

Important Notes

    Ensure that you comply with Twitter's automation rules to avoid account suspension.
    Keep API keys and sensitive information secure. Do not expose them in your code or public repositories.
